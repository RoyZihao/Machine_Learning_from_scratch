# Machine Learning Tutorials 
- This repository contains a topic-wise curated list of Machine Learning tutorials, articles and other resources.
- This tutorial focus on building the machine learning algorithms from scratch using Numpy! You will be able to understand the mathematical reasons behind all those cool algorithms and implement them by yourself with knowledge in linear algebra and calculus.
